Weatherly is a basic weather iOS application that let's you search forcasts for specific cities. 
When you search a city, it shows you the temperature in degree Celcius and an icon changes according to weather condition.

## API
The API used in this project is provided by [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org) through a JSON format. It returns current weather condition using geocoordinates of your search or your current location.

## CoreLocation
I used CoreLocation to locate the userâ€™s location when the green button on the left side of the search bar is pressed.
